## 🧪 Ticket Handling Workflow

This final lab simulated day-to-day help desk operations by creating and resolving tickets from both end-user and agent perspectives.

### 🗒️ Ticket 1: Banking System Outage
- **Created by End User**: Reported online banking outage
- **Handled by**: Jane (SysAdmins)
- **SLA**: Sev-A (1 hr)
- **Team**: Online Banking
- Practiced assigning critical tickets and learned how permissions restrict visibility across departments.

### 🗒️ Ticket 2: Adobe Upgrade
- **Created by End User**: Broken Adobe software in Accounting
- **Handled by**: John (Support)
- **SLA**: Sev-B (4 hrs)
- Understood assignment best practices and aligning severity with business needs.

### 🗒️ Ticket 3: CFO Laptop Won’t Boot
- **Created by End User**
- **Handled by**: John (Support)
- **SLA**: Sev-B (4 hrs)
- Developed escalation and visibility awareness by toggling SysAdmins as a top-level department.

### 🔍 Observations
